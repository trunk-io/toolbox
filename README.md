### Welcome

We know, we know...toolbox? That's only one step above 'UTILS', but a toolbox is a real thing, unlike a UTILS, so it's kosher. 

Toolbox is our collection of must have tools for any large software project. We've got a backlog of small tools to built into our toolbox here and happy to take contributions as well.



### Rules

To enable the toolbox rules in your repository run:

```bash
trunk check enable trunk-toolbox
```

| rule | description               |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| DONOTLAND      | Sometimes you write some code but want to make sure it doesn't actually land. With this rule you can keep yourself from that embarrassing commit that get's pushed for review with hacks or temporary junk inside it  |
